# General

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

All your scripts should be exactly two lines long ($ wc -l file should print 2)

All your files should end with a new line (why?)

The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bash

A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository

A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, describing what each script is doing

You are not allowed to use backticks, &&, || or ;

All your scripts must be executable. To make your file executable, use the chmod command: chmod u+x file. Later, we’ll learn more about how to utilize this command.

# In order to test your scripts, you will need to use this command: chmod u+x file. We will see later what does chmod mean and do, but you can have a look at man chmod if you are curious.
